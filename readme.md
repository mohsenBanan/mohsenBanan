The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem
=========================================

I am an engineer and researcher. Over the past two decades, I have been working
on creating a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and ethics-oriented
non-proprietary digital ecosystem. We call it <font size="+1"><b>ByStar (By*)</font></b>. ByStar challenges
the existing proprietary American digital ecosystem while operating concurrently
alongside it. ByStar's primary offerings are tangible autonomy and genuine
privacy on a very large scale. ByStar represents a moral inversion of the
proprietary American internet services model. Recently, I authored a book
outlining an interdisciplinary blueprint for the realization of ByStar.

Much of what you find on GitHub today represents the surrogate activities of
tunnel-vision technocrats (sec 12.1.7). These engineers often produce or improve
component-oriented FOSS projects that are typically tactical and limited in
scope. These often come with corporate-friendly "permissive" licenses,
ultimately catering to the interests of large American proprietary internet
service providers. ByStar, however, follows a different model. ByStar's
repositories are structured as public GitHub organizations that align with the
architecture of ByStar itself. All these components primarily contribute to our
own digital ecosystem, exclusively composed of Libre-Halaal software subjected
to the 
<a href="https://github.com/mohsenBanan/mohsenBanan/LICENSE">AGPL</a>.
Key engineering components of ByStar include:
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>BISOS: </font></b> 
<a href="https://github.com/bisos">By* Internet Services Operating System</a> ---
On top of Debian, BISOS builds a unified and universal framework for developing
both internet services and software-service continuums that use internet
services. 
<br> 
<font size="+1"><b>Blee: </font></b>
<a href="https://github.com/bx-blee">By* BISOS Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment</a> ---
On top of Emacs and BISOS, Blee creates a
comprehensive integrated usage and development environment. Blee and BISOS are
fully integrated.
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>BPO: </font></b>
<a href="https://github.com/bisos-pip/bpo">BISOS Portable Objects</a> ---
With Git and similar to Apt, BPO establishes a platform for packaging of data,
software, and configurations of software. This creates a uniform model for
portability, encompassing services and personal information.
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>PALS: </font></b> --- 
<a href="https://github.com/bisos-pip/pals">Possession Assertable Libre Services</a> ---
With BPO and BISOS, PALS construct a model for optional self hosting of
services. In ByStar, individual-oriented services belong to the individual and
through PALS, autonomy and privacy is enforceable.
