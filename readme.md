The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem
=========================================

I am an engineer and a researcher based in Seattle, WA, USA. Over the past 20
years I have been working on the construction of a comprehensive,
interdisciplinary, ambitious and complex ethics-oriented, non-proprietary
digital ecosystem that would both challenge the existing proprietary American
digital ecosystem and operate concurrently alongside it. We call it ByStar
(By*). ByStar primary offerings are tangible autonomy and genuine privacy on
very large scale. ByStar is a moral inversion to the proprietary American
internet services model. I recently authored a book that outlines an
interdisciplinary for realization of ByStar.

Most of what is on Github today reflects surrogate activities of tunnel vision
engineers that produce or improce components oriented results which then feed
into the current corporate American service. ByStar model is different.
ByStar git respositories are structured
as organization that match architecture of ByStar. All of these are 
components that primarily feed our own Digital ecosystem.
Key components of ByStar include:
<br>

<font size="+1"><b>BISOS: By* Internet Services Operating System</font></b> ---
On top of Debian, BISOS builds a unified and univeral framework for developing
both internet services and software-service continuums that use internet
services.

<br> 

<font size="+1"><b>Blee: BISOS Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment</font></b> --- On
top of Emacs and BISOS, Blee builds an comprehensive integrated usage and
development environment. Blee and BISOS are fully integrated.
